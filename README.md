### Final Project - Arianna's Artwork Extravaganza

For the final project of Web Design 2, I will be making a website for an artist that I know. Her name is Arianna. The main goal of this website is to show a gallery of her work and have people be able to **easily** contact her for art commisions if they want to work with her.

She is an artist that has a very bubbly artstyle, but she still implaments pieces of reality to show that not everything "cute" can be only for kids. We have worked together in different projects in the past, so I would like to cooperate with her once again to show some of her work off.
