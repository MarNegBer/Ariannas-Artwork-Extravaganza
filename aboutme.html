 I have been able to draw since I have been able to write with a pencil. Though I have been drawing for a while, I have never really saved my earlier work. Despite that, I still occasionally recreate some of my older drawings that weren't thrown out. It is a very satisfying experience to see how far I've grown as an artist. But regardless, here is some of my best work so far, as they show my more recent works.
